# Skin_Disorder_Prediction
Skin_Disorder_Prediction is a machine learning project that classifies six types of skin diseases using clinical and histopathological features. It aids dermatologists in accurate, early diagnosis and reduces the need for invasive procedures.

## Dataset Information:

This database contains 34 attributes, 33 of which are linear valued and one of them i 
nominal.The differential diagnosis of erythemato-squamo s diseases is a real probl m
in dermatology. They all share the clinical features of erythema and scaling, with v ry
little differences. The disease  in this group are psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, li hen
planus, pityriasis rosea, cronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Usually a biop y is
necessary for the diagnosis but unfortunately these diseases shar  many
histopathological features as well. Another difficulty for the diffe ential diagnosis is that a
disease may show the features of another disease at the beginning stage and  ay have
the characteristic features at the  ollowing stages. Patients were first evaluated c inically
with 12 features. Afterwards, skin samples were taken for the evalua ion of 22
histop thological features. The values of the histopathological features are determined
by an analysis of the samples under a microscope.In the dataset con truc ed for this
domain, the family history feature has the value 1 if any of these dise ses has been
observed in the family, and 0 otherwise. T e age feature simply represe ts the age of
the patient. Every other feature (clinical and histopathological) was gi en a degree in
the range of 0 to 3. Here, 0 indicates that the feature was not present, 3 indicates the
largest amount possible, and 1, 2 indicate the relative intermediate val es.The names
and id numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database.
